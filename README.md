## Project Overview

Passion project attempting to design a sleek website about formula 1. 

## Motivation

Heavily invested in Formula 1 and therefore thought it would be a fun exercise to attempt to design something of interest. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Tech/frameworks Used

Built with 

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

### Features

Used Koalendar for calendar integration to book appointments in sync with Google Calendar. 

### Approach Taken

Initially designed a mockup and then proceeded to build the different set pieces. 

### Difficulties encountered when building this

Incorporating the videos was difficult, but upon discovering that Chrome only allows muted videos to render did I understand what to do.
